# ACM-41020  
**Applied Mathematics for Machine Learning**

This repository is dedicated to a collection of machine learning tasks and methodologies I learned from my course ACM41020, focusing on the mathematical foundations and computational techniques used in machine learning. Below is an outline of the key areas covered:

## Neural Networks
- Introduction to Neural Networks
- Activation Functions
- Network Architecture
- Backpropagation
- Universal Approximation Theorem
- Regularization
- Convolutional Neural Networks

## Optimization
- Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Momentum and Adaptive Methods
- Newton’s Method

## Textbooks and Other Resources
- **“Linear Algebra and Learning from Data” by Gilbert Strang**  
  Covers the linear algebra underpinning machine learning.
- **“Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow et al.**  
  A state-of-the-art introduction to neural networks.
- **“Mathematics for Machine Learning” by Deisenroth et al.**  
  Explores the mathematical foundations with minimal computation.
- **“Neural Networks and Deep Learning” by Michael Nielsen**  
  An intuitive guide with Python examples.

This repository serves as a resource for understanding the interplay between applied mathematics and machine learning, providing practical applications and theoretical insights.
